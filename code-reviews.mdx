# Enter DangerJS!

> Danger runs during your CI process, and gives teams the chance to automate common code review chores.

In other words, you can make the robot the bad guy!
---
# Before entering the Danger Zone...

Create Team Standards + Rules.
```notes
One of the primary purposes of a code review is to make sure that code is meets team criteria + standards.
Once the rules are in place, automation becomes a little easier.
```

# Setting up Danger
---
# Getting set up
1. Install Danger in your project
2. Create a bot account for Danger to post to your Code Review (currently only support for GitHub)
3. Tell your CI how to pass the access token / GitHub URL / current Pull Request number to Danger
4. Create a Dangerfile
5. Run it!

# New Rule: No Missing Tests

The Rule: Every new file our team creates should have a minimum test coverage of N%.
---
# Set-up

First, configure your test runner to output a JSON Coverage report:
```
jest --coverage --json --outputFile="./coverage-report.json"
```
---
# Danger Globals

Tools provided by Danger for working with modified/added files:
* `danger.git.created_files` - New Files
* `danger.git.deleted_files` - Files that were removed
* `danger.git.modified_files` - Files that were changed.
---
export default FullScreenCode

```js
const MINIMUM_TEST_COVERAGE = 0.5

const jsFileTest = /.js$/
const testFileTest = /.test.js$/
const storiesFileTest = /.stories.js$/

const filesNeedingTests = danger.git.created_files
  .filter(f => isJsFile(f) && !isTestFile(f) && !isStorybookFile(f) && !whiteListedFiles.includes(f))
  .filter(f => {
      // The path in the test report is an absolute path.
      const absPath = path.resolve(f)
      const report = testReport[absPath]

      // If there's no report, this file isn't part of a coverage, so should not be included.
      if (!report) {
        return false
      }

      const { statements: { pct } } = report
      return pct < MINIMUM_TEST_COVERAGE
    }))
```

# Reporting to the PR

Danger provides utilities for how it will post to the Pull Request:
* `danger.info` - Tidbits
* `danger.warn` - Draw attention
* `danger.fail` - Request Changes on the PR.
---
export default FullScreenCode

```js
if (filesNeedingTests.length) {
  const filesNeedingTestsOutput = filesNeedingTests.
    map(f => .map(f => '- `' + f + '`')).join('\\n')
  const output = `It looks like you've added some new files, but forgot the tests.
  
  Missing Test Files: 
  ${filesNeedingTestsOutput}`
  warn(output)
}
```

# New Rule: Preserve Reviewer Sanity

The Rule: Encourage developers to keep their PRs under 400 LoC.
---
export default FullScreenCode

```js
const LARGE_PR_LINES = 400

if (danger.github.pr.additions > LARGE_PR_LINES) {
  warn('This is a long PR. For the sanity of reviewers,'
    + 'please limit PRs to be less than 400 LoC')
}
